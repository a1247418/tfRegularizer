Regularization approaches for teacher forcing

The aim is to midigate the negative bias teacher forcing introduces in the training process and to investigate what grammatical structures can effectivly be learned without teacher forcing.

To this end, two versions of RNNs will be implemented:  
1) A deterministic RNN
2) A sequential VAE

to be updated...
