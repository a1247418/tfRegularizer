Regularization approaches for teacher forcing

## Goal Statement
The aim is to mitigate the negative bias teacher forcing introduces in the training process and to investigate what grammatical structures can effectively be learned without teacher forcing.

To this end, two versions of RNNs will be implemented:  
1) A deterministic RNN
2) A sequential VAE

## Progress
So far a vanilla LSTM RNN has been implemented, with the option to search over hyper-parameters via grid search and random search.

Developement is paused to focus on a different project.
